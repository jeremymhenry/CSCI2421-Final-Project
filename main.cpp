 Desc:  Develop a simple database system. The database is to handle
 multiple records, each composed of several fields. The database
 will store its information to a file, addition and deletion of
 records, field modifications, and it will allow users to
 sort records based on the selected keys, and produce reports
 according to predefined criteria.
 
 Status: Compiles on Xcode and the csegrid.
